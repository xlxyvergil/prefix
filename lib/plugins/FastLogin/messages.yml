# In order to split a message into seperate lines you could just make a new line, but keep the '
# Example:
# bla: '&aFirst line
# Second line
# Third line'

# If you want to disable a message, you can just set it to a empty value.
# In this case no message will be sent
# Example:
# bla: ''

# ========= Shared (BungeeCord and Bukkit)   ============

# Player activated premium logins in order to skip offline authentication
add-premium: '&2已加入正版用户列表'

# Player is already set be a paid account
already-exists: '&4你已经在正版用户列表中了！'

# Player is already set be a paid account
already-exists-other: '&4此玩家已经在正版用户列表中了！'

# Player was changed to be cracked
remove-premium: '&2已从正版用户列表中移除'

# Player is already set to be cracked
not-premium: '&4你不在正版用户列表中！'

# Player is already set to be cracked
not-premium-other: '&4此玩家不在正版用户列表中！'

# Admin wanted to change the premium of a user that isn't known to the plugin
player-unknown: '&4找不到该用户！此玩家可能从未加入过这个服务器'

# ========= Bukkit/Spigot/PaperSpigot/TacoSpigot only ================================

# The user skipped the authentication, because it was a premium player
auto-login: '&2欢迎你，正版玩家！已帮你自动登录到服务器'

# The user was auto registered on the first join. The user account will be registered to protect it from cracked players
# The password can be used if the mojang servers are down and you still want your premium users to login (PLANNED)
auto-register: '&2将使用此密码帮你自动注册: %password
不想使用此密码请手动输入指令进行注册'

# Player is not able to toggle the premium state of other players
no-permission: '&4没有权限'

# Although the console can toggle the premium state, it's not possible for the console itself.
# Because the console is not a user. (obviously, isn't it?)
no-console: '&4你不能将控制台添加为正版用户，请输入/premium [player]来添加一个玩家为正版用户'

# The user wants to toggle premium state, but BungeeCord support is enabled. This means the server have to communicate
# with the BungeeCord first which will establish a connection with the database server.
wait-on-proxy: '&6正在发送请求...'

# When ProtocolLib is enabled and the plugin is unable to continue handling a login request after a requested premium
# authentication. In this state the client expects a success packet with a encrypted connection or disconnect packet.
# So we kick the player, if we cannot encrypt the connection. In other situation (example: premium name check),
# the player will be just authenticated as cracked
error-kick: '&4发生了错误'

# The server sents a verify token within the premium authentication reqest. If this doesn't match on response,
# it could be another client sending malicious packets
invalid-verify-token: '&4错误的token'

# The client sent no request join server request to the mojang servers which would proof that it's owner of that
# acciunt. Only modified clients would do this.
invalid-session: '&4无效会话'

# The client sent a malicous packet without a login request packet
invalid-requst: '&4无效请求'

# Message if the bukkit isn't fully started to inject the packets
not-started: '&c服务器尚未完全启动，请稍后重试'

# Warning message if a user invoked /premium command
premium-warning: '&c&l警告: &6这个命令&l只能&6在你是此正版账户的拥有者的情况下执行！
请再次输入&a/premium&6以确认操作'
